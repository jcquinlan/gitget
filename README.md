# gitget
A small library for easily pulling data from GitHub.

Right now I'm still experimenting with how to structure the library, as I want to ensure that a user can use method chaining
to pull the data they want and write it to the document where they want.

All changes should be made to index.js in /src. 

I am totally open to taking this project in any direction, as I'm using it as a learning experience.
